    EvaluateRulesRecord allows users to evaluate incoming records against a configured RulesEngineService.  The actions determined
    by the rules engine will return as flow files with details on the type of action that should be performed, attributes required for executing the action,
    and the facts from the record which triggered the action.
</p>

<h2>Record writer</h2>

<p>
    Users can define a Record Writer for these action records and directly specify the output format and data with the assumption that the
    input schema is the following:
</p>

<pre>
			<code>
{
 "type": "record",
 "name": "action",
 "namespace": "rules",
 "fields": [
   {"name": "type", "type": "string"},
   {"name": "attributes", "type": {"type": "map", "values": "string"}},
   {"name": "facts", "type": {"type": "map", "values": "string"}}
  ]
}
			</code>
		</pre>
